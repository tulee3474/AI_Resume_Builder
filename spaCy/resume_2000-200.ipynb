I will be presenting the current results & research work amongst other researchers and students working in the area. RESEARCH EXPERIENCE A flow-based programming language for Multi-core architecture January 2010 - Till Date Masters Thesis (Work in Progress) Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Dr. R.K.Ghosh & Prof. Harish Karnick •Description: The thesis project is aimed at the design & development of a new shared-memory parallel pro- gramming language for the current and future generations of many-core machines. A programmer expresses problems inherently as an acyclic sequence of computations resulting in the formation of a computation DAG. A DAG diffusion model explicitly exposes the available parallelism at runtime. Recursive architecturing & other proposed constructs achieve the construction rapidly & elegantly. A combination of Cilk style programming, flow based execution and promise based approach is undertaken. The programmer works with persistent stateful entities in a 2D space, whose structure is dynamic and which registers the results to the outside world as signals . The multi-phase processing approach couples non-deterministic construction with deterministic outcomes. The language looks promising for graph-based and non-deterministic problems. Other flow-based problems are being studied. The work is still under progress. Cholesky Factorization for Parallel Architectures July 2010 - November 2010 CS738: Advanced Compiler Optimization Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Prof. Sanjeev K. Aggarwal •Description: The project aimed to exploit the innate parallelism available in the algorithm for Cholesky Fac- torization of a symmetric positive-definite matrix to achieve higher speedups. A blocked algorithm as available in LAPACK has been implemented using Level-3 basic linear algebra operations in square blocked pack (SBP) format & optimized using compiler optimization techniques. The performance was compared on multiple hard- wares using CUDA (GPGPU) & Intel TBB (2,4,16,24 core). Results show that parallelizing a blocked algorithm has no significant benefits over parallelizing the corresponding naıve sequential version. A new digital watermarking scheme for 3D triangular mesh models December 2009 - May 2010 CS698E: Digital Watermarking & Steganography Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Prof. Phalguni Gupta •Description: The project was targeted to come up with a reversible watermark embedding scheme for 3D- Triangular mesh models. The final scheme that was designed integrates a reversible watermarking scheme for 2D Vector data together with a 3D watermarking scheme for mesh-models in a novel fashion resulting in increased capacity at slight/acceptable visual distortion in terms of PSNR. The approach was to replicate watermarking sequence into the range images of multiple Voronoi patches of the mesh. Object Tracking Using SIFT features June 2009 - Nov 2009 CS676: Computer Vision & Image Processing Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Dr. Simant Dubey •Description: The project investigated the accuracy of using Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) features as a similarity measure for object tracking of a previously unknown object. The proposed strategy outperforms Camshift algorithm & Lucas-Kanade optical flow methods in most scenarios, however certain number of SIFT features are required to be present. A Kalman filter was used for Gaussian noise-reduction. OTHER COURSE PROJECTS Compiler Design for a subset of C++ language December 2008 - May 2009 CS335: Compiler Design Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Prof. Sanjeev K. Aggarwal •Description: The aim of the project was to develop a compiler for a subset of C++ language. The final working compiler could tackle primitive data types, dynamic scoping using hierarchical symbol table structure, pointer arithmetic, type coercion, loops, conditionals, functions and recursion. File Compressor & Archiver December 2008 - May 2009 CS653: Functional Programming Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Prof. Piyush P. Kurur •Description: The project implemented adaptive Huffman encoding(Vitter Algorithm), Burrrows-Wheeler trans- form and LZ encoding schemes in a pipelined way to achieve high compression ratio for files. The project was built in the functional language Haskell. The project stands successfully completed with good compression ratios and performance. Comparison of TCP performance over WLAN December 2009 - May 2010 CS634: Mobile Computing Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Dr. R.K.Ghosh •Description: The project compares and studies theoretically the behavior of various TCP protocols over wireless LAN. Simulations were done for a selected few protocols. Traffic conditions, packet error rates, transmissions rates were simulated for some WLAN protocols. SNOOP protocol was found to be the best performing among others. Peer to Peer File sharing Client July 2008 - November 2008 CS425: Computer Networks Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Prof. Harish Karnick •Description: The project was aimed at implementing a bit-torrent like peer-to-peer client for LAN. The project implements some of the specifications mentioned in the original P2P protocol by Bram Cohem. The project successfully achieves fast and reliable file sharing using SHA-1 hash algorithm, handling congestion control. FRUD: Framework for Distributed Computing of Unstructured Data December 2009 - May 2010 CS455: Software Engineering Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Prof. T.V. Prabhakar •Description: The project was about development, documentation and maintenance of a library for distributed computing of large quantities of data, akin to Hadoop and Map-Reduce. Java was chosen to develop the library. File Sharing Search Engine December 2008 - May 2009 CS315: Principles of Database Management Dept. of CSE, IITK •Advisor: Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya. •Description: The project provides users an account-based access to a on online storage space. The web-based interface provides different levels of access to the resources on the server based on the class(paid/trial) of the user. A user can upload/download and search for desired files. A relational database is used for storing the account information. INTERNSHIP/WORK EXPERIENCE Microsoft India Development Center May 2009 - July 2009 •Intern Position: : Program Manager + Software Development Engineer •Mentor: Mr. Gautam Bajekal •Description: : I worked with the Office Communicator team at MSIDC, working as a Program Manager. The task was to co-ordinate, propose, develop, finalize and implement a ”Silverlight Based framework for Rapid Prototyping of web-based Office Communicator(OC)”. Various In-meeting and Out-of-Meeting scenarios were developed, demonstrated and discussed amongst a team of senior program managers. The internship provided exposure to a healthy team-based work environment and insight of the industrial work-culture. TALKS/LECTURES Software Transactional Memory (STM) July 2010 - November 2010 CS738: Advanced Compiler Optimizations •I gave a lecture on Software Transactional Memory.

High Dynamic Range Imaging (HDRI) July 2009 - November 2009 CS76: Computer Vision & Image Processiong •I gave a lecture explaining the HDRI approach covering the entire process of capturing multiple LDR images, creating HDR image from the set of these LDR images, storing them in HDR format and rendering these to a LDR display using tone mapping. TEACHING EXPERIENCE Fundamentals of Computing (ESC101) July 2010 - November 2010 Description : I tutored a batch of 40 freshmen in the ESC101 course. A tutor designs problems for the lab tests and exams, teaches students and arranges tutorials to clear students doubts. I also provided students with additional weekly notes , covering various topics spread across the duration of a semester, to assist them with the lecture materials and provide them a richer, in-depth and a broader learning experience of the C programming language.
