{"id":5,"text":"Software Engineer Resume Sample (Hired) (Full Text Version)\nConner Aiken\nAddress: Kent, Washington\nDate of birth: 1993-02-06\nPhone number: contact hidden\nProfile\nHello! I am Conner and I am a software engineer working on web applications and web infrastructure. I have been developing professionally for 5 years but tinkering since a kid. I started in tech with internships, freelance services and part time positons during college.\n\nI have a bit off a diverse job history. I have had positions in help desk, graphic\/web design, web app development and sysadmin\/devops. I can help everywhere in the stack and I love wearing multiple hats to an extent. Although, I do think my most strongest skills are in software engineering and server administration.\n\nMost of my positions utilized agile-like development processes using JIRA\/TFS. I am also a certified scrum master with ScrumAlliance.\n\nA day in my life may consist of: prepping web art, fixing some front-end bugs, adding an API endpoint, dockerizing an application, database design, configuring a unit or ui test library, setting up a build or deployment plan, provisioning a test tier machine or feature work when I am lucky.\n\nWork experience\n10\/2017 - present, Software Engineer II, Allen Institute, Seattle, Washigton\nAt my current position, I am working on 3D and 2D data visualization web apps for brain and cellular research. We use technologies such as: Three.JS, D3, React and NodeJS. We have a ton of python code but I have not had the opportunity to work on any python projects.\n\nIn addition to full stack development, I also working on a lot of dev-ops tasks. I have helped set up a lot of our unit, ui and build\/deploy plans. Also other process improvement tasks like JIRA transition workflows, slack notification services and BitBucket\/JIRA\/GitHub API services. We utilize ansible for our automation, bamboo for our build\/deployment, bitbucket for our git repositories and confluence\/github pages for our documentation. We manage portions of our CentOS test\/internal tier as well.\n\n01\/2015 - present, Web Application Developer, Fitted Technology, Seattle, Washington\nFitted Tech is my sole proprietorship. Through it, I offer web development and graphic design services a few times a year. Most of my clients ask for front end development. Mainly, business portfolio websites.\n\n02\/2017 - 10\/2017, Developer, Quorum Review, Seattle, Washington\nAt my previous job, I was responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining mostly internal web applications. I collaborated with technical and business staff in the design, development, testing, implementation and production support of enterprise applications.\n\nWe primarily used MEAN Stack. 40% of my work was doing front end development, 40% back end development and the remaining 20% was dev-ops\/sys admin related tasks. We had a few sys admins for a 300 person+ company. They were very swamped so I was occasionally asked to do things such as migrating test database data between environments, doing jenkins builds\/minor build plan tweaks, configuring webpack\/or ui\/unit testing frameworks.\n\n12\/2015 - 02\/2017, Developer, Bio-Tech Medical Software Inc., Olympia, Washington\nAt Bio-Tech, I was working on PHP, Javascript (AngularJS and vanilla) and Perl based services and applications.\n\nSome of my web apps included: Digital menuboards, mobile\/desktop business dashboards, online website plugins and APIs.

{"id":24,"text":"HEATHER VANDERVECHT\nSenior Frontend developer\nToronto, Ontario | heathervv.com\nAvid learner, debate lover, and forever optimist. I like creating products that either a) have fun and nifty features or b) solve a problem for people. I especially love creating products that have both of those things! Above all that, I really love supporting my team so everyone feels good bringing their authentic selves to work. My hobbies include messing around with random JS libraries, day dreaming about space, and eating snacks. I‚Äôm currently teaching my dog how to touch!\nH\nV\nWORK EXPERIENCE\nDIALOGUE\nStaff Engineer | Sep 2021 - Current\nOPENCARE\nTech Lead, Senior Frontend Developer | Mar 2020 - Aug 2021\nAs the tech lead for the Patient Growth team, I really wore many hats and helped with many things (ask me!) but my main areas of focus were defining the technical vision, reducing tech debt (AngularJS -> React), mentoring, and working with the product, marketing, and customer enablement teams to prioritize features. I also improved processes and empowered the team in order to increase test coverage and reduce bugs. Additionally I built Opencare's first design library with the design team, and built a custom analytics package to simplify integrating analytics across the multiple apps (Snowplow, Fullstory, Heap, Optimizely). Tech stack was predominantly React, Typescript, Jest\/React Testing Library, and styled-components, using a rest API built in Node.\n\nPIVOTAL SOFTWARE, INC\nSenior Software Engineer | May 2019 - Feb 2020\nWith a focus on TDD and pair programming, at Pivotal I worked primarily in Kotlin, Spring Boot, and Cloud Foundry to build and deploy products that helped internal team members with their day-to-day work. I also helped with the R&D phase for new products in order to determine the right technical solutions.\n\nNASCENT\nFullstack Developer | May 2017 - May 2019\nAt Nascent I built isomorphic web applications using React, Redux, Node, and Express. I also used CI\/CD services to manage deployments. In addition to growing and sharpening my skills as a full stack developer, I worked with leadership and clients to assess and explore upcoming features and projects and helped mentor my teammates.\n\nBLUNT\nCo-founder, Developer | Jan 2017 - Nov 2017\nWith a desire to create unique work, Blunt was created. Like most (all) startup companies, I wore many hats on a very small team! To name the keys ones, I was the developer, project manager, and point of contact for clients. One highlight of what I was responsible for was learning how to research the best architectural solutions for projects. I handed Blunt fully over to my partner a little under a year after starting it so I could focus more fully on my full-time role.\n\nFILAMENT CREATIVE INC.\nLead Front End Developer | Apr 2016 - Apr 2017\nAs the lead developer, my main role was to engage with clients and support and mentor the members of my team. I also spearheaded the creation of a development process that improved the workflow and introduced new technologies into projects. I built with WordPress, React, and ExpressionEngine on this team, as well as learned the basics of servers.\n\nRESOLUTION INTERACTIVE MEDIA\nFront End Developer | Dec 2014 - Apr 2016\nPredominantly front end work, I also designed several websites and was the back end developer in other projects when possible. I worked with WordPress, Drupal, PyroCMS, and Jekyll (with prose.io integrated for content management). I helped improve the company-wide development process and was front end lead on several projects.\n\nREDRHINO INC.\nJr Web Developer | Jul 2013 - Dec 2014\nMy job at RedRhino consisted of creating websites and providing support for existing sites. I worked mostly with WordPress or hardcoded sites, and did both back end and front end. Additionally, a large portion of my time was spent doing production work for designers, and providing feedback to the designers as to best practices when designing for the web.\n\nEDUCATION\nFANSHAWE COLLEGE INTERACTIVE MEDIA DESIGN AND PRODUCTION, MEDIA\n2011 - 2013\nSKILLS\nTechnical mentoringRoadmappingProduct thinkingMentorshipWeb app developmentReactReact NativeJavaScriptTypescriptAccessibilityUX\/UINodeJSREST API DevelopmentQuality Assurance","label":[[20,45,"work experience"],[590,604,"work experience"],[635,671,"work experience"],[885,895,"skill"],[898,903,"skill"],[1128,1283,"work experience"],[1354,1359,"skill"],[1361,1371,"skill"],[1373,1383,"skill"],[1479,1503,"work experience"],[1601,1607,"skill"],[1609,1620,"skill"],[1843,1862,"work experience"],[1938,1943,"skill"],[1945,1950,"skill"],[1952,1956,"skill"],[1962,1969,"skill"],[2225,2246,"work experience"],[2768,2792,"work experience"],[2858,2923,"work experience"],[3194,3213,"work experience"],[3273,3361,"work experience"],[3377,3386,"skill"],[3388,3394,"skill"],[3396,3403,"skill"],[3409,3416,"skill"],[3469,3563,"work experience"],[3580,3596,"work experience"],[3651,3709,"work experience"],[3766,3797,"work experience"],[3987,4050,"education"],[4145,4150,"skill"],[4150,4162,"skill"],[4162,4172,"skill"],[4172,4182,"skill"],[4200,4206,"skill"]]}
