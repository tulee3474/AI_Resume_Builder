{"id":5,"text":"Software Engineer Resume Sample (Hired) (Full Text Version)\nConner Aiken\nAddress: Kent, Washington\nDate of birth: 1993-02-06\nPhone number: contact hidden\nProfile\nHello! I am Conner and I am a software engineer working on web applications and web infrastructure. I have been developing professionally for 5 years but tinkering since a kid. I started in tech with internships, freelance services and part time positons during college.\n\nI have a bit off a diverse job history. I have had positions in help desk, graphic\/web design, web app development and sysadmin\/devops. I can help everywhere in the stack and I love wearing multiple hats to an extent. Although, I do think my most strongest skills are in software engineering and server administration.\n\nMost of my positions utilized agile-like development processes using JIRA\/TFS. I am also a certified scrum master with ScrumAlliance.\n\nA day in my life may consist of: prepping web art, fixing some front-end bugs, adding an API endpoint, dockerizing an application, database design, configuring a unit or ui test library, setting up a build or deployment plan, provisioning a test tier machine or feature work when I am lucky.\n\nWork experience\n10\/2017 - present, Software Engineer II, Allen Institute, Seattle, Washigton\nAt my current position, I am working on 3D and 2D data visualization web apps for brain and cellular research. We use technologies such as: Three.JS, D3, React and NodeJS. We have a ton of python code but I have not had the opportunity to work on any python projects.\n\nIn addition to full stack development, I also working on a lot of dev-ops tasks. I have helped set up a lot of our unit, ui and build\/deploy plans. Also other process improvement tasks like JIRA transition workflows, slack notification services and BitBucket\/JIRA\/GitHub API services. We utilize ansible for our automation, bamboo for our build\/deployment, bitbucket for our git repositories and confluence\/github pages for our documentation.

Mainly, business portfolio websites.\n\n02\/2017 - 10\/2017, Developer, Quorum Review, Seattle, Washington\nAt my previous job, I was responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining mostly internal web applications. I collaborated with technical and business staff in the design, development, testing, implementation and production support of enterprise applications.\n\nWe primarily used MEAN Stack. 40% of my work was doing front end development, 40% back end development and the remaining 20% was dev-ops\/sys admin related tasks. We had a few sys admins for a 300 person+ company. They were very swamped so I was occasionally asked to do things such as migrating test database data between environments, doing jenkins builds\/minor build plan tweaks, configuring webpack\/or ui\/unit testing frameworks.\n\n12\/2015 - 02\/2017, Developer, Bio-Tech Medical Software Inc., Olympia, Washington\nAt Bio-Tech, I was working on PHP, Javascript (AngularJS and vanilla) and Perl based services and applications.\n\nSome of my web apps included: Digital menuboards, mobile\/desktop business dashboards, online website plugins and APIs. I was also responsible for the managing my team's web infrastructure, seo, marketing and website design. Most of the servers I dealt with were Debian\/Ubuntu and I utilized DigitalOcean for off-site hosting.\n\n01\/2014 - 05\/2015, Mac Lab Assistant, Concordia University: Irvine, Irvine, California\nAt my first university, I was a help desk technician in our mac lab. Outside of class, I helped students with printer, device and software issues.\n\n05\/2014 - 01\/2015, Web Application Engineer, Technijian Inc, Irvine, California\nAt my first full stack job, I was doing front-end development with HTML, CSS, Javascript and back-end development with PHP. We utilized MySQL and PostGres. In addition to development, I also helped with end-user support for stakeholders and designated end users when escalated above our support teams.\n\nFor the last half of this position, I led a team of 3 developers for our company's largest web app contract: a fitness video and recipe center for Ultimate Fighting Championship's gyms.\n\n12\/2013 - 05\/2014, Intern, Third Stone Media, Irvine, California\nThird Stone Media provided me with an internship where I found my passion for programming and web development.
