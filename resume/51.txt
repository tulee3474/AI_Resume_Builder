CASEY DAVIS
Front-End Web Developer and Designer
Grand Rapids, Michigan | caseykdavis.com
As a front-end developer with a strong design background, I take a holistic approach in the consideration of every new project. I believe that great design is a result of the collaboration between designers, developers and stakeholders, whose combined experience and efforts come together to create great user experiences. I believe that great user experiences are created through understanding not only user expectations and goals, but also the commitment to help see through expectations and goals through effective storytelling and enhanced functionality. As a designer and developer, I aspire to be apart of a team that is oriented in this way, and look forward to applying my knowledge and skill toward the concept and creation of sophisticated digital products.
