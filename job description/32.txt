Front-End Software Engineer [Remote - AMER]
Confluent is pioneering a fundamentally new category of data infrastructure focused on data in motion.

That’s the power of data in motion in action—giving organizations instant access to the massive amounts of data that is constantly flowing throughout their business. At Confluent, we’re building the foundational platform for this new paradigm of data infrastructure. Our cloud-native offering is designed to be the intelligent connective tissue enabling real-time data, from multiple sources, to constantly stream across the organization. With Confluent, organizations can create a central nervous system to innovate and win in a digital-first world.

We are looking for a Front-End Software Engineer interested in building engaging and insightful products for managing and visualizing large scale distributed real-time data streams.
